1) Prerequisites:


    * You must have a Kinect device.
    * This application is intended to be used in Ubuntu 10.04 lts, it could be extended to be used in Windows.
    * The applicacion needs a little of processing power, we tested it in Dual core Laptops, it's not really 
      a requisite, but it could run very slow in a poor machine.


2) Instalation


    First of all, you must be sure to have this packages:

    * GCC 4.x
    * Python 2.6+/3.x
    * LibUSB 1.0.8
    * OpenGL/GLUT

    To install this packages in Ubuntu just run the following for the missing packages.

    * sudo apt-get install g++ python libusb-1.0-0-dev freeglut3-dev libjpeg-dev libpng-dev libglu1-mesa-dev mesa-common-dev

    Next you need to install the OpenNI. We used the unstable version. Here are the steps to install it. We use the git command so 
    if you don't have it installed you cand run.

    1. aptitude install git-core

    Ok here are the steps to install OpenNI:

    1. mkdir ~/Kinect && cd ~/Kinect
    2. git clone https://github.com/OpenNI/OpenNI.git
    3. cd OpenNI/Platform/Linux-x86/CreateRedist && ./RedistMaker
    4. cd ../Redist && sudo ./install.sh

    That's all. Now we have OpenNI installed. Now we can install the avin2 diver.

    1. cd ~/Kinect
    2. git clone https://github.com/avin2/SensorKinect.git
    3. cd SensorKinect/Platform/Linux-x86/CreateRedist && ./RedistMaker
    4. cd ../Redist && sudo ./install.sh

    Now we need to install the NITE middleware. We used Nite 1.3.0.18 (Unstable).

    1. go to this page and download the latest NITE.
    2. Save the NITE tarball to ~/Kinect.
    3. tar -jxvf NITE-Bin-Linux32-v1.3.0.18.tar.bz2
    4. cd ~/kinect/NITE/Nite-1.3.0.18/Data
    5. Edit all xml files and replace the license with this one "0KOIk2JeIBYClPWVnMoRKn5cdY4="
    6. Also replace the MapOutputMode line to look like this "< MapOutputMode xRes="640" yRes="480" FPS="30"/>"
    7. niLicense PrimeSense 0KOIk2JeIBYClPWVnMoRKn5cdY4=
    8. cd ~/kinect/NITE/Nite-1.3.0.18/
    9. sudo ./install.sh
    10. make && sudo make install

    All ready. Now we have the OpenNI, avin2 and NITE software installed. We only need to install GLM library to start playing.

    1. mkdir ~/glm
    2. Download the GLM library from this page and save it to ~/glm.
    3. cd ~/glm && tar -zxvf glm-0.3.1.tar.gz
