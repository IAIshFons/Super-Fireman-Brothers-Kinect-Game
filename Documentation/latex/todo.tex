\item[page \hyperlink{index}{Super Fireman Brothers} ]There is some problems with the floor drawing related to the Kinect position, the floor drawing is done by detecting the floor area with the OpenNI functions and draw the pixels of the detected floor. If you place the Kinect in an area that you cannot see the floor it will be drawn in a wrong way so the application will not run effectively, the problems are experienced if the area you place the Kinect is really small or some objects obstruct the floor. Another way to draw the floor could be a good solution. 

There is a system of listeners wich consists in classes that describe the different type of characters you can use, the abstract listener type could be improved in a way that the new user callback could be used directly to listen for \hyperlink{classZamus}{Zamus} or \hyperlink{classLinq}{Linq} types. 

Implement a way to win the game of Super Fireman Brothers, actually the game is intended for competing between players, the one with highest score is the winner.
