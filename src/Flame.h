 *  @brief This class contains the information about one flame in the
 *  game.
 *
 *  Tha flames have helth points (hp) that gets reduced when the flames
 *  are hit by a shoot of a player. The flames are hit when the position
 *  of a shoot is into the bounding box of the flame.
 *
 *  Aditionaly the flames only move in the Z axis. When they go to far,
 *  the game ends.
